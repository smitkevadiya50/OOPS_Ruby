# Ruby OOP Concepts Examples

## Overview
This repository showcases four fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Ruby: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. Each file provides a practical and educational example of these key OOP principles.

## Files and Descriptions

### Abstraction.rb
- **Description:** An example demonstrating the concept of Abstraction in Ruby. Abstraction is about hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionalities.

### Encapsulation.rb
- **Description:** This file serves as an Encapsulation example in Ruby. It illustrates how data and methods can be bundled into a single unit, or class, to protect the internal state of an object.

### Inheritance.rb
- **Description:** A practical example showcasing Inheritance in Ruby. This file demonstrates how a new class can inherit properties and methods from an existing class, promoting code reuse.

### Polymorphism.rb
- **Description:** This file provides an insight into Polymorphism in Ruby. It illustrates how Ruby objects can take on many forms, leveraging method overriding and duck typing.

## Getting Started
To run these examples, ensure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can execute each script directly from the command line.

Example:
```bash
ruby Abstraction.rb
